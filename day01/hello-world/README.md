# Day 1

On the first day I looked up a simple tutorial to understand how to initialize, structure and run the simpliest form of a program written in Go.

## Takeaways

1. In Go there are 2 types programs:

   - Executeables - Executeable programs that can be run from the terminal.
   - Libraries - Collections of reusable code packaged together so we can use them in other programs.

2. Before running a Go program it must be initialized first as a module

   e.g.:
   `go mod init hello-world`
